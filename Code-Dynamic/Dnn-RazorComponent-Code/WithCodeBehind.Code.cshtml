  This is the .Code.cshtml file for old Razor APIs

  It has some public functions for re-use.

  This is an old feature and doesn't work in newer base classes,
  but we created the test because we had some issues in 16.07 LTS

@functions {
  public string GetTitle()
  {
    return "Hello World";
  }
}
